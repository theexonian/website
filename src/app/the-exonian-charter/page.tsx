				<p>
					<strong>Preamble</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Exonian </em>is a student newspaper published
					bi-weekly during the school year at Phillips Exeter Academy.
					The newspaper’s purpose is to inform the Academy community
					about events, trends and ideas and to provide an educational
					experience through working journalism.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Exonian </em>strives to protect the status of an
					independent student-run newspaper because we believe our
					independent voice best serves our readership of students,
					faculty and staff, parents and alumni/ae. In the words of
					the Journalism Education Association, “A good newspaper
					serves its readers only when it is editorially
					independent.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Exonian</em> strives to maintain professional
					standards of accuracy, fairness and objectivity. Staff
					members claim a broad right to report and editorialize about
					all issues, including unpopular or controversial ones.{" "}
					<em>The Exonian </em>
					is not subject to prior review, prior restraint or
					censorship. Staff members have an obligation to understand
					and to meet the legal and ethical responsibilities expected
					of practicing journalists.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					<strong>Organization of the Staff</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Exonian’s </em>editorial staff consists of an
					Executive Board headed by the editor-in-chief, an Upper
					Board, and a Lower Board. The Upper Board produces the
					newspaper week to week under the overall direction of the
					editor-in-chief and the Executive Board. Upper Board members
					include section editors (News, Opinion, Exeter Life, Sports
					and Humor), photo and graphics editors, and such other
					positions as the editor-in-chief may designate. The Lower
					Board carries out reporting and editing assignments at the
					direction of the Executive Board and the Upper Board and is
					the newspaper’s management-in-waiting.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					<strong>Guiding Principles for Independence</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					As stated in the preamble, <em>The Exonian </em>strives to
					protect its status as a student-run newspaper, and therefore
					the independent voice of students, in order to best serve
					our readership. With training and consultation from the
					editors and faculty advisers, <em>The Exonian </em>staff has
					an obligation to understand and to meet the legal and
					ethical responsibilities expected of practicing journalists.{" "}
					<em>The Exonian</em> is not subject to prior review,
					restraint or censorship.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Exonian </em>staff and school administration retain
					liability for the operations of the student publication and
					its content. In all circumstances, and especially when
					covering topics that may be sensitive and/or controversial,
					the following principles should be upheld:&nbsp;
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<em>The Exonian</em> board and school administration
							will adhere to the Publications Guidelines specified
							in the E-Book.&nbsp;
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The editor-in-chief assumes total responsibility for
							the decisions of publication. That being said, the
							editor-in-chief should understand that the school
							administration remains liable for{" "}
							<em>The Exonian.</em> <em>The Exonian</em> staff and
							school administration should work together to uphold
							the First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and
							press in order to best serve the community.&nbsp;
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Faculty advisers are the primary mentors to students
							in their editorial decisions.&nbsp;
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The editor-in-chief is responsible for reaching out
							to the administration, when appropriate, about
							concerns, including those regarding student safety.
							The school administration should not act as a censor
							of <em>The Exonian. </em>If the administration is to
							reach out to <em>The Exonian</em>, it should contact
							the editor-in-chief directly, who will work in
							concert with <em>The</em> <em>Exonian </em>
							advisers.&nbsp;
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In the spirit of Harkness, all parties should fully
							explain their position, context, and reasoning to
							the extent that they are able.&nbsp;
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In certain circumstances, if the administration is
							unable to provide full detail or context to its
							concerns for reasons of confidentiality, the
							editor-in-chief, faculty adviser, and administration
							should discuss and come to a consensus on the manner
							in which to proceed.&nbsp;
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In accordance with the 2016-2017 E-Book, if a
							consensus is not reached, <em>The Exonian </em>will
							follow Publications Guidelines subpoint number 7 and
							appeal to the Publications Committee for a final
							decision.&nbsp;
						</p>

				<h1><i>The Exonian</i> Values Statement</h1>
				<p>
					<em>
						Adopted on February 2, 2020 by the 142nd Executive
						Board.
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>has two primary missions and an
					educational objective.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first role of the paper is to chronicle Exeter’s
					history. The community relies on&nbsp;
					<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>to report on individuals and
					events with accuracy. The paper tracks the Academy’s
					evolution, so it can continue to evolve.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly,&nbsp;<em>The Exonian</em>&nbsp;is a vehicle for
					positive change. By covering—or uncovering—the state of the
					Academy, the paper’s independent reporting leaves the truth
					in the readers’ hands. As a result, it transforms Exeter
					into a more transparent and equitable institution.
				</p>
				<p>
					In all its endeavors,&nbsp;<em>The Exonian</em>
					&nbsp;reflects the Exeter community, even when perspectives
					are difficult to find or underrepresented. The paper seeks
					out diverse voices and offers a forum for the fair and
					holistic representation of dissimilar opinions.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Simultaneously,&nbsp;<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>is a high
					school newspaper entrusted by the community to act in an
					appropriate and conscientious fashion. The paper is not
					devoted to transparency at the expense of the community’s
					well-being. In moments when articles require sensitivity,
					the paper must balance accuracy and community values.
				</p>
				<p>
					The last objective of the paper, as the bylaws detail, is to
					provide its staff with an educational experience practicing
					journalism, including content production, management of
					ethical responsibilities and collaboration.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>
						The 146th&nbsp;Board of&nbsp;<em>The Exonian</em>, just
						as the Boards before it, must continue to push the
						envelope in a thoughtful manner to deliver impactful
						information to the Exeter community.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<h4>Content and Scope</h4>
				<p>
					Operating as the free student press,&nbsp;
					<em>The Exonian</em>&nbsp;is not subject to prior review or
					censorship. Staff of&nbsp;<em>The Exonian</em>&nbsp;have the
					right to report on all topics that may be relevant,
					including those which may be controversial.&nbsp;
					<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>will not publish content that is
					defamatory or obscene.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>holds irrevocable license to all
					content made for or published by the paper, in all forms
					past, present and future. Parties involved with&nbsp;
					<em>The Exonian</em>&nbsp;should understand that content
					produced for the paper, including quotations and all media,
					are subject to future use, distribution, publication and
					archival by&nbsp;<em>The Exonian</em>&nbsp;in print or
					online, in part of normal newspaper operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Opinion pieces published in&nbsp;<em>The Exonian</em>
					&nbsp;are works of the sole author or authors and do not
					necessarily reflect the views of&nbsp;
					<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>or Phillips Exeter Academy. Staff
					editorials are typically unsigned and express the majority
					opinion of&nbsp;<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>board at the time
					of publication.
				</p>
				<h4>Corrections and Integrity</h4>
				<p>
					In the case that errors are made,&nbsp;
					<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>will make corrections as necessary
					and append a notice to the content indicating the earlier
					mistake. As is standard in news organizations,&nbsp;
					<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>does not take down content
					published online. With this in mind, writers should be
					cognizant that their published work will persist on&nbsp;
					<em>The Exonian</em>&nbsp;website and within the archives —
					news, humor and opinion pieces alike. Only in extreme cases
					(in the case of immediate threat to student safety, for
					example) will&nbsp;<em>The Exonian</em>&nbsp;board review
					and decide if removal of content is necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					All staff of&nbsp;<em>The Exonian&nbsp;</em>share the legal
					and ethical responsibilities of practicing journalists;
					contributing student and staff writers alike are trained and
					expected to report with fairness and accuracy. The
					Editor-in-Chief assumes total responsibility for the
					publication.
