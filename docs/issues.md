# Issues

List of issues present (that may present future fixes/headaches)

## Back End: Double records due to Strapi + Postgres integration

[Strapi Issue #21393](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/21393)

## Front End: NextJS 15 + React 19 Blocked

Many front end components depend on React 18, so updating to NextJS 15 (which requires React 19) doesn't work for now.
