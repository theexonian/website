					Unger participated in theater, frequently directing and
					acting. “Unger, too, was convincing in his role as John, a
					lonely man who comes to Connie and tries to make believe
					that she is actually his past love.”

					Co-captain of the boys team, Unger enjoyed competing in
					cross-country, and now coaches the same team he competed on
					as a student. “Some of this unification can be attributed to
					the co-captains, Weiske and Unger, who took the races
					seriously, but helped to ease the tension with sudden
					renditions of the team song, ‘Danke Schon.’”

					In Unger’s Latin classes from 110 to 210, his students
					roleplay ancient Romans in a simplified version of the
					ancient Roman empire called the “Unger Games,” in the
					process of learning about Roman culture, history, mythology,
					and language. “Unger is a well-recognized figure on campus,
					known for his ceaseless passion for Latin and language and
					Roman culture, and love for running and support of the cross
					country team.”

					Mr. Moriarty won the Fourth Award for Short Short Story.
					He’s an English teacher for a reason!

					“For someone from the midwest, this place opened up the
					world to me. Pre-internet, the only way other than reading a
					lot to really learn about the world and people outside of
					your community was to move and be in different places. So I
					feel very lucky to have had a chance to come to a place with
					kids from all over and to learn from what we shared and from
					differences. PEA opened up the world not just on campus but
					gave me a chance to do SYA in Spain. My to-be best friend
					also lived in Cilley and we went to Spain together. He was a
					lot braver than me and helped me take chances abroad to try
					new things and meet new people.”
